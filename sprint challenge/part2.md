Despite having a straightforward interface, I belive that databricks is the lesser platform versus AWS. AWS's optionality and support put it far ahead, in my opinion.

Dask is easily my favorite library. I am biased as Dask is similar to pandas, a tool that is quite familiar to me. If I am to be objective on the functionality across libraries I would choose Dask and Spark, but due to my prior knowledge, Dask is the choice for me.

As far as languages go there is hard to choose a 'best' one. Python is essential when working with smaller datasets (or samples) in order to wrangle and interpret data. SQL is necessary to store and retrieve data, big and small. And Scala is important when working with massive amounts of data and a team is utilizing Spark. I believe all three play important parts in a data scientist's toolbox.
